This repository contains the solutions to the Challenge number 2 of the DevOps technical assessment

<p> In this repository, you can find the source code of our php application in the path /src/Average.php</p>
<p> There are 2 workflows as required, one to be able to deploy to one destination and the other to deploy to multiple destinations</p>
<p> Didn't have an ftp server so I used a linux machine as alternative to destination server</p>
<p> Deploy stage doesn't work as expected, due to time constrain was unable to debug it</p>
<p> All the other requirements are working fine </p>
